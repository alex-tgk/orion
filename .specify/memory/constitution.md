# ORION Platform Constitution

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Living Document

## Purpose

This constitution establishes the foundational principles, standards, and governance that guide all technical decisions and development work on the ORION platform. These principles serve as the bedrock for specification-driven development, ensuring consistency, quality, and alignment with organizational goals.

## Core Values

### 1. User-Centric Development
- Every feature must solve a real user problem
- User experience takes precedence over technical elegance
- Accessibility is a requirement, not an option
- Performance directly impacts user experience and must be measured

### 2. Production-First Mindset
- All code must be production-ready from day one
- No mock data, facades, or simulated responses in production features
- Real AI integrations only - no placeholder implementations
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation required

### 3. Test-Driven Quality
- All new code must have corresponding unit tests
- Integration tests required for service interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Test coverage minimum: 80% for all new code

### 4. Security by Design
- Authentication and authorization required for all protected endpoints
- Input validation on all external data
- Secrets never committed to repository
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- HTTPS/TLS required for all external communication

### 5. Operational Excellence
- Comprehensive logging with structured output
- Health checks for all services
- Metrics and monitoring instrumentation
- Graceful shutdown and startup procedures
- Database migrations must be reversible

## Technical Standards

### Architecture Principles

#### Microservices Design
- Each service owns its own database schema
- Services communicate via well-defined APIs (REST/gRPC) and message queues
- No direct database access across service boundaries
- Each service must be independently deployable

#### API Design
- RESTful conventions for HTTP APIs
- Consistent error response format across all services
- Versioning strategy for breaking changes
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints

#### Data Management
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Database migrations via Prisma Migrate
- Redis for caching and session management
- RabbitMQ for async messaging (optional)

### Code Quality Standards

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Strict TypeScript mode enabled
- ESLint configuration enforced
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- No `any` types without explicit justification
- Functional programming patterns preferred where appropriate

#### NestJS Backend Services
- Module-based organization
- Dependency injection for all services
- Guards for authentication/authorization
- Interceptors for cross-cutting concerns
- DTOs with class-validator decorators
- Clean separation: Controllers → Services → Repositories

#### React Frontend Applications
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript for all component code
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Component composition over inheritance
- Props validation with TypeScript interfaces

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
- All business logic must have unit tests
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use Jest as testing framework

#### Integration Tests
- Test service-to-service communication
- Test database operations with test database
- Test message queue interactions
- Use Docker Compose for integration test environment

#### E2E Tests
- Critical user journeys must have E2E tests
- Run against production-like environment
- Automated via CI/CD pipeline

### Performance Standards

- API response time: < 200ms (p95)
- Page load time: < 2s (First Contentful Paint)
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
- Database query time: < 100ms (p95)
- Memory usage: No leaks, stable under load

### Documentation Requirements

#### Code Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- README.md in each service package
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant choices
- API documentation via OpenAPI/Swagger

#### Specification Documentation
- All features require specifications in `.specify/specs/`
- Follow GitHub Spec Kit methodology
- Update specs when requirements change
- Maintain traceability from spec to implementation

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
- Main branch is always deployable
- Feature branches for all development
- Pull requests required for all changes
- Minimum one reviewer approval
- CI checks must pass before merge

### Commit Standards
- Conventional commit format: `type(scope): message`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Reference issue numbers in commits
- Squash commits on merge to main

### Specification-Driven Development
- Use `/speckit.constitution` for project principles
- Use `/speckit.specify` for feature specifications
- Use `/speckit.plan` for implementation plans
- Use `/speckit.tasks` for task breakdowns
- Use `/speckit.implement` for systematic implementation

### Code Review Principles
- Review for correctness, not style (automated by linters)
- Ensure tests cover new functionality
- Verify security implications
- Check performance impact
- Confirm documentation is updated

## Deployment Standards

### Environment Management
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Environment-specific configuration via environment variables
- No secrets in code or configuration files
- Use secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

### Deployment Methods
- PM2 for development/small deployments
- Docker for containerized deployments
- Kubernetes for production at scale
- Blue-green or canary deployment strategies

### Monitoring and Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Distributed tracing for service calls
- Metrics collection (Prometheus format)
- Alerting on critical errors and performance degradation

## AI Integration Standards

### Real AI Only
- No mock implementations in production code
- All AI features must use real AI providers:
  - Claude (Anthropic)
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Amazon Q
  - Google Gemini
  - OpenAI Codex
- Fallback strategies for AI service failures
- Caching for AI responses where appropriate

### AI Service Architecture
- PM2-managed services for each AI CLI wrapper
- Standardized request/response format
- Error handling and retry logic
- Rate limiting to prevent quota exhaustion
- Cost monitoring for API usage

## Feature Flag Management

### Feature Flag Strategy
- All experimental features behind feature flags
- Feature flags manageable via admin dashboard
- Gradual rollout capability
- A/B testing support
- Kill switches for problematic features

### Feature Flag Lifecycle
- Flags start as `experimental`
- Graduate to `beta` after initial validation
- Move to `stable` after proven in production
- Remove flag after 100% rollout
- Document flag removal in changelog

## Governance

### Decision Making
- Architecture decisions require team discussion
- Breaking changes require RFC (Request for Comments)
- Security changes require security team review
- Performance changes require load testing validation

### Constitution Updates
- This constitution is a living document
- Updates require pull request and team review
- Major changes require consensus
- Version history maintained in git

### Exceptions
- Exceptions to these principles require explicit justification
- Document exceptions in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Review exceptions quarterly
- Plan migration path for technical debt

## Enforcement

### Automated Checks
- Linting and formatting enforced pre-commit
- Test coverage measured in CI
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Dependency license checking

### Manual Reviews
- Code review checklist includes constitution compliance
- Architecture reviews for significant changes
- Security reviews for authentication/authorization changes
- Performance reviews for data-intensive features
