## Key Coordination Mechanisms

### 1. File Ownership
**Problem Solved**: Prevent merge conflicts and file editing collisions

**Solution**:
- Every file has a designated owner
- Clear ownership symbols: ✅ (own), 🔒 (exclusive), ⚠️ (needs approval), 👁️ (read only)
- Complete ownership matrix in FILE_OWNERSHIP_MAP.md
- "Can I modify this?" quick reference

**Example**:
```
/packages/auth/src/        → Workstream 1 OWNS
/packages/shared/contracts/ → Workstream 6 EXCLUSIVE (others READ ONLY)
/packages/user/prisma/     → Workstream 2 proposes, Workstream 8 APPROVES
```

---

### 2. Contract Management
**Problem Solved**: API contract changes affect multiple services

**Solution**:
- Single Contract Owner (Workstream 6) has exclusive write access
- All contract changes go through approval process
- 24-hour review SLA
- Automatic notification to affected services
- Semantic versioning for breaking changes

**Workflow**:
```
Service Team → GitHub Issue (contract-change) → Contract Owner Review (24h)
→ Contract Owner Implements → Notifies All Affected Teams
```

---

### 3. Database Coordination
**Problem Solved**: Schema changes need review, cross-service data relationships

**Solution**:
- Database Lead (Workstream 8) reviews all schema changes
- 48-hour review SLA
- Naming convention enforcement
- No cross-database foreign keys allowed
- Event-driven synchronization patterns

**Architecture**:
```
Each Service → Own PostgreSQL Database
Cross-service data → Events or API calls, NOT foreign keys
```

---

### 4. Integration Points
**Problem Solved**: Services need to communicate without conflicts

**Solution**:
- 5 defined integration points:
  1. API Contract Synchronization
  2. Database Schema Coordination
  3. Event-Driven Communication
  4. Frontend-Backend Integration
  5. Shared Dependencies
- Clear protocols for each integration point
- Weekly sync meetings

---

### 5. Communication Protocols
**Problem Solved**: Coordination across distributed teams

**Solution**:
- **Slack** (`#orion-dev-coordination`): Daily standups, quick questions
- **GitHub Issues**: Contract changes, schema changes, feature requests
- **Pull Requests**: Code review, implementation discussion
- **Weekly Sync**: Integration review, demo, planning

**Daily Standup Template**:
```
Workstream: [Name]
Completed: [Yesterday's work]
In Progress: [Today's work]
Blocked: [Any blockers]
```

---

## Conflict Prevention Strategy

### Three-Layer Defense

**Layer 1: Clear Boundaries**
- Every workstream has exclusive file ownership
- FILE_OWNERSHIP_MAP.md defines all boundaries
- Visual directory tree with ownership annotations

**Layer 2: Approval Gates**
- Shared resources require approval from designated owner
- Contract Owner for API contracts
- Database Lead for schemas
- 2 approvals for root configuration files

**Layer 3: Automated Quality**
- Pre-commit hooks (linting, formatting)
- CI/CD checks on every PR
- Type checking catches interface mismatches
- Test coverage requirements (>80%)

---

## Quality Standards (Enforced)

### Code Quality Gates
All PRs must pass:
1. ✅ Linting (`pnpm lint`)
2. ✅ Type checking (`pnpm type-check`)
3. ✅ Formatting (`pnpm format:check`)
4. ✅ Tests (`pnpm test`) with >80% coverage
5. ✅ Build (`pnpm build`)

### Coding Standards
- **TypeScript**: `strict: true`, no implicit any
- **NestJS**: Dependency injection, module structure
- **Testing**: AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- **Commits**: Conventional commits enforced by commitlint
- **Formatting**: Prettier (single quotes, 80 chars, 2 spaces)

---

## Critical Path

**Must Complete First** (Blocking):
1. Workstream 6: Shared Contracts (Days 1-2)
2. Workstream 7: Infrastructure Libraries (Days 1-3)
3. Workstream 8: Database Schemas (Days 2-4)

**Then Start** (Dependent):
4. Workstreams 1-3: Backend Services (Days 3-7)

**Integration Phase**:
5. Workstream 4: Gateway (Days 5-10)
6. Workstream 5: Admin UI (Days 6-12)

**Continuous**:
7. Workstreams 9-10: Testing & DevOps (Throughout)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Contract changes mid-dev | High | Strict change control via Contract Owner |
| Schema conflicts | High | Database Lead authority, migration reviews |
| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Centralized package.json, Infrastructure approval |
| Integration delays | High | Early integration points, weekly syncs |
| Divergent code styles | Low | Automated linting/formatting via pre-commit |
