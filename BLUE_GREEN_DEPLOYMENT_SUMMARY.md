# Blue-Green Deployment Implementation - Executive Summary

**Section 8.4 Item #18a: Implement Blue-Green Deployments**

**Status:** COMPLETE ✓  
**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Overview

Comprehensive blue-green deployment infrastructure has been successfully implemented for all ORION microservices (auth, gateway, notifications, user). This enables zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback capabilities.

---

## Implementation Deliverables

### 1. Kubernetes Manifests (4 files)

**Location:** `/k8s/deployment-strategies/blue-green/`

- `auth-blue-green.yaml` (9.2KB) - Auth service blue-green configuration
- `gateway-blue-green.yaml` (9.3KB) - Gateway service blue-green configuration  
- `notifications-blue-green.yaml` (12KB) - Notification service blue-green configuration
- `user-blue-green.yaml` (11KB) - User service blue-green configuration

**Each manifest includes:**
- Blue deployment (active environment)
- Green deployment (inactive environment)
- Main service with slot-based routing
- Blue-specific testing service
- Green-specific testing service
- ServiceAccount
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler (for scalable services)

### 2. Deployment Automation Script

**Location:** `/scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh` (16KB, 616 lines)

**Capabilities:**
- Automated blue-green deployment for single or all services
- Active/inactive slot detection
- Health check monitoring with configurable retries
- Automated smoke testing
- Traffic switching with post-switch monitoring
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

**Usage:**
```bash
# Deploy single service
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh auth v1.2.3

# Deploy all services
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh all v1.2.3

# Deploy without switching traffic
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh gateway v1.2.3 --no-switch
```

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

---

## Key Features

### Zero-Downtime Deployments
- Traffic switches instantly between blue and green environments
- No service interruption during deployments
- Seamless updates for end users

### Instant Rollback
- Rollback time: < 30 seconds
- Simply switch service selector back to previous slot
- No redeployment required

### Production Testing
- New version deployed to production infrastructure
- Tested in real environment before receiving traffic
- Isolated testing via slot-specific services

### Automated Operations
- Full deployment automation via script
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Automated health checks and smoke tests
- Auto-rollback on failure

### Multi-Service Support
- Individual service deployments
- Deploy all services simultaneously
- Consistent deployment process across services

---

## Architecture

### Slot-Based System

```
Blue Slot (Active)              Green Slot (Inactive)
├── Deployment (3 pods)         ├── Deployment (0 pods)
├── Service (testing)           ├── Service (testing)
└── Resources                   └── Resources

Main Service → Routes to Active Slot (blue or green)
```

### Deployment Flow

```
1. Detect active slot (blue) and inactive slot (green)
2. Update green deployment with new image
3. Scale green from 0 to 3 replicas
4. Wait for green pods to be ready
5. Run health checks on green
6. Execute smoke tests on green
7. Switch main service selector to green
8. Monitor green for 60 seconds
9. Scale blue down to 0 replicas
✓ Deployment complete
```

### Rollback Flow

```
1. Detect issue in green deployment
2. Switch main service selector back to blue
3. Scale blue to 3 replicas (if needed)
4. Verify blue is healthy
✓ Rollback complete (< 30 seconds)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Deployment

```bash
# Deploy auth service
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh auth v1.2.3

# Output will show:
# - Active/inactive slot detection
# - Image update
# - Scaling operations
# - Health checks
# - Smoke tests
# - Traffic switching
# - Monitoring
# - Cleanup
```

### Deploy All Services

```bash
# Deploy all services with same version
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh all v1.2.4
```

### Test Before Production

```bash
# Deploy to inactive slot without switching
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh gateway v1.2.3 --no-switch

# Test via slot-specific service
kubectl port-forward service/gateway-green 8080:3000 -n orion

# Run tests manually
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# If tests pass, manually switch traffic
kubectl patch service gateway -n orion \
  -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"slot":"green"}}}'
```

### Quick Rollback

```bash
# Instant rollback - switch service selector
kubectl patch service auth-service -n orion \
  -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"slot":"blue"}}}'

# Ensure blue is running
kubectl scale deployment auth-service-blue --replicas=3 -n orion
```
