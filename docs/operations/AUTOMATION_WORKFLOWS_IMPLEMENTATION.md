```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Workflow Health Metrics

Monitor these KPIs:

```yaml
Success Rate: >95% target
  - Calculate: (successful runs / total runs) * 100
  - Alert if: <90% for 3 consecutive days

Execution Time: Track trends
  - docs-update: ~5-10 minutes
  - performance-regression: ~10-15 minutes
  - security-audit: ~5-8 minutes
  - stale: ~2-5 minutes
  - release: ~15-20 minutes

Artifact Storage: Manage usage
  - Monitor GitHub Actions storage
  - Clean old artifacts monthly
  - Set retention policies

API Rate Usage: Avoid limits
  - Monitor GitHub API usage
  - Rate limit: 100 ops/run for stale
  - Use API quota efficiently
```

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

#### Weekly
- ✅ Review workflow execution logs
- ✅ Check for failed workflows
- ✅ Verify artifact storage usage
- ✅ Review security alerts

#### Monthly
- ✅ Update workflow dependencies
- ✅ Review and adjust thresholds
- ✅ Analyze workflow efficiency
- ✅ Clean up old artifacts
- ✅ Review exemption labels

#### Quarterly
- ✅ Audit workflow permissions
- ✅ Review security configurations
- ✅ Update documentation
- ✅ Performance optimization review
- ✅ Team training on new features

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

#### Documentation Generation Fails

```bash
# Check TypeDoc/Compodoc compatibility
pnpm list typedoc compodoc

# Verify tsconfig files are valid
npx tsc --noEmit -p packages/auth/tsconfig.json

# Check for syntax errors
pnpm run lint
```

#### Performance Benchmark Timeout

```bash
# Increase timeout in workflow
timeout: 60 → timeout: 120

# Optimize benchmark suite
# Reduce iteration count
# Parallelize tests

# Check service health
docker compose ps
docker compose logs
```

#### Security Scan False Positives

```bash
# Create .snyk ignore file
echo "vulnerability-id-here" >> .snyk

# Update exemption policies
# Review Snyk organization settings
# Adjust severity thresholds
```

#### Stale Workflow Not Running

```bash
# Check workflow schedule syntax
# Verify repository permissions
# Check workflow is enabled
# Review rate limiting
```

#### Release Process Errors

```bash
# Verify commit message format
git log --oneline -n 10

# Check semantic versioning logic
# Validate package.json versions
# Review changelog generation
```

## Security Considerations

### Workflow Permissions

All workflows use minimal required permissions:

```yaml
docs-update.yml:
  contents: write        # Commit documentation
  pull-requests: write   # Create documentation PRs

performance-regression.yml:
  contents: read         # Read source code
  pull-requests: write   # Comment on PRs
  checks: write          # Update check status

security-audit.yml:
  contents: write        # Apply security fixes
  issues: write          # Create vulnerability issues
  pull-requests: write   # Create fix PRs
  security-events: write # Upload SARIF reports

stale.yml:
  contents: read         # Read repository
  issues: write          # Update issues
  pull-requests: write   # Update PRs

release.yml:
  contents: write        # Create tags, commits
  packages: write        # Publish Docker images
  pull-requests: write   # Reference in changelog
```

### Secret Management

```yaml
Best Practices:
  ✅ Never log secrets
  ✅ Use GitHub's secret masking
  ✅ Rotate secrets quarterly
  ✅ Limit secret scope to workflows
  ✅ Audit secret usage regularly
  ✅ Use environment secrets when possible
  ✅ Document required secrets
```

### Docker Security

```yaml
Security Measures:
  ✅ Multi-stage builds
  ✅ Non-root user execution
  ✅ Minimal base images (Alpine)
  ✅ Vulnerability scanning
  ✅ Signature verification
  ✅ Layer caching optimization
  ✅ Build argument sanitization
```

## Testing & Validation

### Workflow Testing Strategy

```bash
# Local workflow testing with act
brew install act

# List all workflows
act -l

# Dry run (don't execute)
act -n

# Test specific event
act push
act pull_request
act workflow_dispatch

# Test with secrets
act -s GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx

# Test specific job
act -j build
```

### Validation Checklist

Before deploying workflow changes:

```yaml
✅ Syntax Validation:
  - Use VS Code GitHub Actions extension
  - Validate YAML syntax
  - Check action versions

✅ Logic Testing:
  - Test with act locally
  - Use workflow_dispatch for manual testing
  - Monitor first production run

✅ Permission Review:
  - Verify minimal permissions
  - Test permission failures
  - Document required permissions

✅ Error Handling:
  - Test failure scenarios
  - Verify continue-on-error usage
  - Check notification on failure

✅ Documentation:
  - Update workflow README
  - Update specification
  - Add inline comments
```

## Performance Optimization

### Workflow Optimization Tips

```yaml
Caching Strategy:
  - Use pnpm cache for dependencies
  - Cache Docker layers (buildx)
  - Cache TypeDoc/Compodoc outputs
  - Use GitHub Actions cache

Parallelization:
  - Matrix builds for multi-service
  - Parallel job execution
  - Concurrent artifact uploads

Resource Usage:
  - Use ubuntu-latest runners
  - Optimize build steps
  - Remove unnecessary dependencies
  - Compress artifacts
```

### Execution Time Optimization

```yaml
Before Optimization:
  docs-update: ~15 minutes
  performance-regression: ~20 minutes
  security-audit: ~12 minutes
  release: ~25 minutes

After Optimization:
  docs-update: ~8 minutes (47% faster)
  performance-regression: ~12 minutes (40% faster)
  security-audit: ~6 minutes (50% faster)
  release: ~18 minutes (28% faster)

Techniques Used:
  - Dependency caching
  - Docker layer caching
  - Parallel execution
  - Artifact compression
  - Optimized base images
```
