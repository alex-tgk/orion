## Recording Workflow

### Pre-Recording Checklist

```markdown
- [ ] Script reviewed and practice run completed
- [ ] Recording software configured and tested
- [ ] Microphone tested (record 30s, listen back)
- [ ] Terminal font size increased (16-18pt)
- [ ] VS Code zoom increased (1-2 levels)
- [ ] Desktop cleaned and notifications disabled
- [ ] Glass of water nearby
- [ ] Quiet environment confirmed
- [ ] Test recording saved to correct location
```

### Recording Process

#### 1. Slate (Introduction)

Record a slate at the beginning:
```
"This is Tutorial [Number] - [Title]
Take [Number]
Date: [Today's date]"
```

This helps during editing to identify recordings.

#### 2. Recording Tips

- **Start with silence**: Record 3-5 seconds before speaking
- **End with silence**: Record 2-3 seconds after finishing
- **Pause on errors**: Stop, wait 3 seconds, restart from last section
- **Mark good takes**: Make a note of timestamp for best versions
- **Save frequently**: Save every 10-15 minutes

#### 3. Multiple Takes

- Record each section 2-3 times
- Don't stop recording between takes
- Clap or snap to mark take boundaries
- Review audio levels between sections

#### 4. Screen Actions

- **Slow down**: Move mouse slower than normal
- **Highlight cursor**: Use cursor highlighter software
- **Pause before typing**: Let viewers see what you're about to do
- **Wait for output**: Give time to read command output
- **Use keyboard shortcuts visibly**: Show what keys you're pressing

### Recording Segments

Break tutorials into segments:

1. **Introduction** (1-2 minutes)
   - Topic overview
   - Learning objectives
   - Prerequisites

2. **Main Content** (sections of 3-5 minutes each)
   - One concept per segment
   - Clear transitions between sections

3. **Conclusion** (1 minute)
   - Recap what was learned
   - Next steps
   - Resources

## Editing Guidelines

### Editing Workflow

1. **Import & Organize**
   - Create project folder: `tutorial-XX-title/`
   - Subfolders: `raw/`, `audio/`, `assets/`, `export/`
   - Name files descriptively

2. **Assembly Edit**
   - Remove mistakes and retakes
   - Select best takes of each section
   - Remove long pauses (keep natural breathing)
   - Trim intro/outro silence to 1-2 seconds

3. **Fine Edit**
   - Cut filler words
   - Adjust pacing
   - Sync audio if needed
   - Add B-roll if needed

4. **Audio Processing**
   ```
   1. Noise Reduction (if needed)
   2. EQ: High-pass filter at 80 Hz
   3. Compression: Ratio 3:1, Threshold -18 dB
   4. Normalize: -3 dB peak
   5. Limiter: -1 dB ceiling
   ```

5. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Add title cards
   - Add callouts/annotations
   - Highlight important text
   - Add zoom effects (sparingly)

### Annotations & Callouts

#### When to Use
- Highlighting important commands
- Pointing out key output
- Emphasizing warnings or errors
- Showing keyboard shortcuts

#### Guidelines
```yaml
Color Scheme:
  - Info: Blue (#007AFF)
  - Success: Green (#34C759)
  - Warning: Orange (#FF9500)
  - Error: Red (#FF3B30)

Font: Sans-serif, bold
Size: 24-32pt
Animation: Fade in/out (0.3s)
Duration: 3-5 seconds
```

### Transitions

- **Between sections**: Simple fade (0.5s)
- **Between topics**: Fade to black (1s) + title card
- **No**: Fancy wipes, spins, or complex transitions

### B-Roll & Supplementary Content

- Architecture diagrams
- Code snippets (isolated)
- Documentation screenshots
- Terminal output (enlarged)

### Music (Optional)

If using background music:
- **Intro/Outro only**: Keep main content clean
- **Volume**: -20 to -18 dB (much quieter than voice)
- **Style**: Ambient, non-distracting
- **License**: Royalty-free (YouTube Audio Library, Artlist, Epidemic Sound)
