# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-01-15
**Deciders:** Architecture Team, CTO
**Technical Story:** Initial architecture design for ORION platform

---

## Context

We needed to decide on the overall architecture pattern for the ORION platform. The system must:
- Support multiple teams working independently
- Scale components independently
- Enable rapid feature development
- Support polyglot persistence if needed
- Facilitate testing and deployment

---

## Decision

We will implement a **microservices architecture** with the following characteristics:

1. **Service Boundaries**: Each service owns its domain and data
2. **Communication**: Synchronous (HTTP/REST) and asynchronous (message queue)
3. **Database**: Database per service pattern
4. **API Gateway**: Single entry point for clients
5. **Service Discovery**: Static configuration initially, dynamic later

---

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Independent deployment of services
- ✅ Technology flexibility per service
- ✅ Clear ownership boundaries
- ✅ Easier to scale specific components
- ✅ Improved fault isolation
- ✅ Smaller, focused codebases

### Negative
- ❌ Increased operational complexity
- ❌ Distributed system challenges (network, consistency)
- ❌ Need for service mesh/orchestration
- ❌ More complex testing (integration/e2e)
- ❌ Data consistency challenges

### Neutral
- ⚖️ Requires strong DevOps culture
- ⚖️ Need monitoring and observability
- ⚖️ Learning curve for team

---

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Architecture
**Pros**: Simple deployment, easier transactions, lower operational cost
**Cons**: Scaling limitations, tight coupling, slower development cycles
**Rejected**: Doesn't meet scalability and team independence requirements

### 2. Modular Monolith
**Pros**: Clear boundaries within single deployment, simpler than microservices
**Cons**: Still single deployment unit, scaling limitations
**Rejected**: Doesn't provide independent deployment capability

---

## Implementation Notes

- Start with core services: Gateway, Auth, User, Notification
- Use NestJS for consistency across services
- Implement shared libraries for common functionality
- Use Nx monorepo for code organization
- Docker containers for deployment
