## Specification-Driven Development

ORION uses the [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for specification-driven development.

**Available Commands:**
- `/speckit.constitution` - Define project principles
- `/speckit.specify` - Create feature specifications
- `/speckit.plan` - Generate implementation plans
- `/speckit.tasks` - Break down into tasks
- `/speckit.implement` - Execute implementation

See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for ORION development principles.
