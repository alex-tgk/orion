## Technical Implementation Details

### Slot-Based Architecture

The implementation uses a slot-based system where:
- **Blue slot**: Currently active/stable version
- **Green slot**: New version being deployed

Pods are labeled with `slot: blue` or `slot: green`, and the service selector controls traffic routing.

### Service Structure

Each service has three Kubernetes Services:
1. **Main Service**: Routes to active slot (production traffic)
2. **Blue Service**: Direct access to blue deployment (testing)
3. **Green Service**: Direct access to green deployment (testing)

### Deployment Flow

```
Current State: Blue Active (3 pods), Green Inactive (0 pods)
                           ↓
Deploy New Version: Update Green image
                           ↓
Scale Up Green: 0 → 3 pods
                           ↓
Wait for Rollout: Green pods become ready
                           ↓
Health Checks: Verify Green deployment health
                           ↓
Smoke Tests: Test Green deployment functionality
                           ↓
Switch Traffic: Service selector: blue → green
                           ↓
Monitor: Watch Green for issues (60 seconds)
                           ↓
Scale Down Blue: 3 → 0 pods (if Green stable)
                           ↓
New State: Green Active (3 pods), Blue Inactive (0 pods)
```

### Rollback Mechanism

Instant rollback is achieved by:
1. Switching service selector back to previous slot
2. Scaling up previous deployment if needed
3. No redeployment required

### Resource Management

Both slots maintain identical resource configurations:
- Requests guarantee minimum resources
- Limits prevent resource overconsumption
- HPA scales based on CPU/memory utilization
- Pod anti-affinity ensures distribution across nodes

### Security Implementation

All deployments include:
- Non-root user execution (UID 1001)
- Read-only root filesystem
- Capability dropping
- No privilege escalation
- Security context enforcement
- Network policy support

```

### All Services Deployment

```bash

# Deploys auth, gateway, notifications, and user services sequentially
```

### Testing Before Production

```bash
# Deploy to green but don't switch traffic
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh gateway v1.2.3 --no-switch

# Test green deployment
kubectl port-forward service/gateway-green 8080:3000 -n orion

# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# If tests pass, manually switch traffic:
kubectl patch service gateway -n orion \
  -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"slot":"green"}}}'
```

### Quick Rollback

```bash
# Instant rollback - switch traffic back to blue
kubectl patch service auth-service -n orion \
  -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"slot":"blue"}}}'

# Ensure blue is running
kubectl scale deployment auth-service-blue --replicas=3 -n orion
```
