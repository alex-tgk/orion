## Technical Architecture

### CI Pipeline Flow

```
Commit → Setup & Cache → Parallel Jobs:
  ├─ Code Quality (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
  ├─ Unit Tests (per service, parallel)
  ├─ Integration Tests (with DB/Redis)
  ├─ E2E Tests (Docker Compose)
  ├─ Build (Nx parallel builds)
  ├─ Docker Build & Scan (Trivy)
  └─ SonarQube Analysis
→ Summary & Notifications
```

### CD Pipeline Flow

```
Develop Branch → Auto Deploy to Dev
Staging Branch → Manual Deploy → Blue-Green → Smoke Tests
Main Branch → Approval → Production Deploy → Canary → Full Traffic
```
