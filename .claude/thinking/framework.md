# Thinking Framework for Orion

## Before Writing Any Code

Ask yourself:
1. What problem am I solving?
2. Why does this problem exist?
3. What's the simplest solution that could work?
4. What could go wrong?
5. How will I know if it's working?

## During Implementation

Continuously evaluate:
- Is this the simplest approach?
- Am I introducing unnecessary complexity?
- Could someone else understand this?
- What assumptions am I making?
- How will this scale?

## After Implementation

Reflect on:
- What did I learn?
- What would I do differently?
- What patterns emerged?
- What can be generalized?
- What documentation is needed?
