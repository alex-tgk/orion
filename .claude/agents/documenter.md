## Documentation Principles

1. **Documentation as Code**
   - Lives with the code
   - Versioned with the code
   - Reviewed with the code

2. **Levels of Documentation**
   - README: What and why
   - API: How to use
   - Code: How it works
   - ADR: Why decisions were made

3. **Keep It Current**
   - Automate where possible
   - Update with changes
   - Remove outdated docs

4. **Audience-Focused**
   - Users: How to use
   - Developers: How to extend
   - Operators: How to run
   - Architects: How it fits
